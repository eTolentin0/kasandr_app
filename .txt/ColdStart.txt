However, as it only consider past interactions to make recommendations, collaborative filtering suffer from the “cold start problem”: it is impossible to recommend anything to new users or to recommend a new item to any users and many users or items have too few interactions to be efficiently handled. This drawback can be addressed in different way: recommending random items to new users or new items to random users (random strategy), recommending popular items to new users or new items to most active users (maximum expectation strategy), recommending a set of various items to new users or a new item to a set of various users (exploratory strategy) or, finally, using a non collaborative method for the early life of the user or the item.
